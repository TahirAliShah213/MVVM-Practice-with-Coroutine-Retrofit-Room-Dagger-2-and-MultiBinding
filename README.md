MVVM Practice with Coroutine, Retrofit, Room, Dagger 2, and MultiBinding
Introduction
This Android project serves as a practice ground for implementing the MVVM architecture pattern along with several key libraries and techniques including Coroutine, Retrofit, Room, Dagger 2, and MultiBinding.

The primary goal of the project is to fetch and display product data from the Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products), allowing offline access through local storage with Room.

Features
MVVM Architecture: Separation of concerns using Model-View-ViewModel pattern.
Coroutine: Asynchronous programming for managing long-running tasks.
Retrofit: Networking library for fetching data from the Fake Store API.
Room: Persistence library for local data storage and offline access.
Dagger 2: Dependency injection framework for managing dependencies.
MultiBinding: Efficient management of multiple ViewModels without creating individual ViewModelFactory instances.
